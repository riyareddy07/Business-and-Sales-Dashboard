# Data Model - Star Schema
The Star Schema is a widely used data modeling technique that optimizes performance for analytical queries. It consists of a central fact table connected to multiple dimension tables, forming a star-like structure. This model enhances query speed and efficiency in Power BI by reducing data redundancy and improving data retrieval.
Benefits of Star Schema:
•	Faster Query Performance – Fact tables store numerical data, and dimensions provide descriptive attributes, allowing quick aggregations.
•	 Simplifies Data Relationships – Easy-to-understand structure where all dimensions link directly to the fact table.
•	Optimized for BI Reporting – Power BI efficiently handles relationships, improving performance in visuals and calculations.
•	Scalability – New dimensions or attributes can be added with minimal impact on the existing schema.
•	Improves Data Integrity – Ensures a single source of truth for analytics and reporting.
